# Improved Flasks

Improved Flasks is a gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

It adds new Quality of Life features to the Insulated Flask item.

You can now drink directly from the flask via the inventory or radial menu (drinks). The ability to fill/transfer to and from the flask is now the secondary action in the inventory screen. 
You may also take partial drinks or sips from the flask and it will preserve the partial item in the flask.

* Ability to drink from the item pickup UI
